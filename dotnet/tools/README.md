# UpdateAssemblyReference Tool

This is a tool which modifies assemblies replacing references.
If an assembly A changes its strong name key, this tool allows to update all the assemblies 
in INTPUT_DIRECTORY that reference A. The tool replaces each reference to [A with the old
strong name key] with a reference to [A with the new strong name key].


## Usage

```
UpdateAssemblyReference [-a <INPUT_ASSEMBLY>] [-d <INPUT_DIRECTORY>]

Given an assembly INPUT_ASSEMBLY with a public key B, it searches for all the assemblies 
in INPUT_DIRECTORY that reference INPUT_ASSEMBLY with public key Z (different from P)
and replaces the public key of the reference by P.

Example:

  UpdateAssemblyReference --assembly C:\DotNetClasses\GxClasses.dll --directory C:\Model\KB\Web\bin

  -v, --verbose      (Default: true) Set output to verbose messages.

  -a, --assembly     Required. The name of the assembly that changed its strong name.

  -d, --directory    Required. Specify a directory to search for assemblies that reference the assembly which changed
                     its strong name. These assemblies will be modified to link the new assembly strong name.

  --help             Display this help screen.

  --version          Display version information.
